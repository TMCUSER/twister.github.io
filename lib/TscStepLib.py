"Step" is used to create steps inside tests.
The idea is to organize one test into smaller steps, that will be executed in order.
Before each step, you can call other functions, to setup something before execution.
After the step runs, all the CLI log is searched using regular expressions
and if any of the expressions is found, the matching functions are called.

For example:
You have a permanent connection, called `conn1`.
You need to test some commands on this connection.
The step function has 3 parameters: a function that will be tested, pre hooks and post hooks.

Pre-hooks are 1 or more simple functions that prepare the connection. They are optional.
Post-hooks are 1 or more pairs of strings + functions. They are also optional.
If one of the strings is found inside the CLI resulted from executed the main function,
the hook is executed. All the matches are executed, in order.


def test_feature1():
    """ This is a big feature. """
    conn1.send('some command you need to test')

def test_feature2(param1, param2):
    """ This is another big feature. """
    conn1.send('some command you need to test')

def prepare_connection1():
    # do something, before sending command 1

def prepare_connection2():
    # do something, before sending command 2

def in_case_of_fail():
    # do something if the connection failed

def in_case_of_crash():
    # treat this...

def in_case_of_success():
    # Enjoy the success


STEP(
    test_feature1,
    prepare_connection1,
    [
        ('general failure', in_case_of_fail),
        ('CORE DUMP', in_case_of_crash),
        ('done', in_case_of_success)
    ]
