Jenkins Plugin is an interface for connecting to a Jenkins continuous
integration server.
After a Jenkins job it's done it will execute the Jenkins Post Script.
This script will verify if the build finished successfully. If yes, it
tells the Twister Plugin that the build is ready.
The plugin will run first the build script in order to upload the build
on the DUT (Device Under Test).
After will start to run the tests previously saved in a Project File.
After execution it will save the result in the database if needed.
